# Steps to Follow

## 1. Configuring Storage and Event Hub Settings

This snippet sets up the necessary connection settings for the storage account and Event Hub.

```csharp
// Azure Storage connection string for checkpoint storage
private const string storageConnectionString = "<Your-Storage-Connection-String>"; // Replace with your Azure Storage account connection string

// Blob container name for checkpoint storage
private const string blobContainerName = "<Your-Blob-Container-Name>"; // Replace with your container name

// Azure Event Hub connection settings
private const string eventHubConnectionString = "<Your-Event-Hub-Connection-String>"; // Replace with your Event Hub connection string
private const string eventHubName = "<Your-Event-Hub-Name>"; // Replace with your Event Hub name
```

### Explanation:
- `storageConnectionString` and `blobContainerName` are used to set up the storage account where Event Hub checkpoints are maintained.
- `eventHubConnectionString` and `eventHubName` allow the program to connect to a specific Event Hub.

## 2. Creating the Event Processor Client

This snippet demonstrates how to create an Event Processor Client for subscribing to events.

```csharp
// Initialize the blob container client for checkpointing
BlobContainerClient storageClient = new BlobContainerClient(
    storageConnectionString, blobContainerName);

// Create an Event Processor Client to consume events from the Event Hub
var processor = new EventProcessorClient(
    storageClient, // Checkpoint storage
    EventHubConsumerClient.DefaultConsumerGroupName, // Consumer group name
    eventHubConnectionString, // Event Hub connection string
    eventHubName); // Event Hub name
```

### Explanation:
- **`BlobContainerClient`**: Connects to the Azure Blob Storage for managing checkpoints.
- **`EventProcessorClient`**: Manages event consumption and checkpointing automatically.
- **Consumer Group**: Specifies the logical group of event consumers. Use the default consumer group or specify a custom one.

## 3. Subscribing to Event Handlers

This snippet attaches event handlers to process received events and handle errors.

```csharp
// Attach event handler for processing events
processor.ProcessEventAsync += ProcessEventHandler;

// Attach event handler for processing errors
processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ProcessErrorHandler;
```

### Explanation:
- **`ProcessEventHandler`**: Handles incoming events from the Event Hub.
- **`ProcessErrorHandler`**: Handles errors encountered during event processing.

---

## 4. Starting and Stopping the Event Processor

This snippet shows how to start and stop the Event Processor Client.

```csharp
// Start processing events
await processor.StartProcessingAsync();
Console.WriteLine("Event Processor started...");

// Allow processing for 30 seconds
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));

// Stop processing events
await processor.StopProcessingAsync();
Console.WriteLine("Event Processor stopped.");
```

### Explanation:
- **`StartProcessingAsync`**: Begins processing events from the Event Hub.
- **`StopProcessingAsync`**: Stops event processing gracefully.
- **`Task.Delay`**: Simulates a waiting period for the processor to run.

---

## 5. Handling Incoming Events

This snippet defines the logic for processing incoming events from the Event Hub.

```csharp
static Task ProcessEventHandler(ProcessEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    // Write the event data to the console
    Console.WriteLine("\tReceived event: {0}", Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventArgs.Data.Body.ToArray()));
    return Task.CompletedTask; // Acknowledge event processing completion
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`ProcessEventHandler`**: Reads and logs the event payload to the console.
- **`eventArgs.Data.Body`**: Contains the event message payload, which is converted to a string for display.

---

## 6. Handling Errors

This snippet defines the logic for managing errors during event processing.

```csharp
static Task ProcessErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs eventArgs)
{
    // Log error details
    Console.WriteLine($"\tPartition '{eventArgs.PartitionId}': an unhandled exception was encountered.");
    Console.WriteLine(eventArgs.Exception.Message);
    return Task.CompletedTask; // Acknowledge error handling completion
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`ProcessErrorHandler`**: Logs errors encountered during processing, including the partition ID and exception message.
- Ensures that errors are captured and logged without halting the processing.

## 7. Full Main Method

This snippet ties all the components together into the main method.

```csharp
static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    // Set up blob storage client
    BlobContainerClient storageClient = new BlobContainerClient(
        storageConnectionString, blobContainerName);

    // Create Event Processor Client
    var processor = new EventProcessorClient(
        storageClient,
        EventHubConsumerClient.DefaultConsumerGroupName,
        eventHubConnectionString,
        eventHubName);

    // Attach handlers
    processor.ProcessEventAsync += ProcessEventHandler;
    processor.ProcessErrorAsync += ProcessErrorHandler;

    // Start processing
    await processor.StartProcessingAsync();
    Console.WriteLine("Event Processor started...");

    // Wait for events to be processed
    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30));

    // Stop processing
    await processor.StopProcessingAsync();
    Console.WriteLine("Event Processor stopped.");
}
```

### Explanation:
- Combines all setup, processing, and cleanup steps into a single flow.
- **`StartProcessingAsync`** and **`StopProcessingAsync`** manage the lifecycle of the Event Processor Client.
